    About
</h2>

<h4>
    The client wanted to revamp and modernize the outdated UI on their existing enteral feeding pump's display and needed
    to down-select options for different features and refine the new Information Architecture.<br />
    The 3 features being tested with users on the new touchscreen UI were:
</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Programming different feeding settings</li>
    <li>Navigating to and viewing the flush (water) settings</li>
    <li>Switching the display into Night Display</li>
</ol>
    RESEARCH GOALS<br />
<ol>
    <li>Identify the extent to which each design concept addressed user needs </li>
    <li>Identify use errors associated with each concept</li>
    <li>Identify users' preferences, perceived benefits, and concerns for each concept</li>
</ol>

    THE CHALLENGE<br />
    Select one concept for each of the 3 tested features to move forward with.


<h2>
    Methodology
</h2>
<!-- Methodology images -->
<img src="images/feeding_pump_img2.png" alt="Methodology Image">
<h4>
    Participants<br />
</h4>
    Target users were:
<ul> 
    <li>Acute Care nurses</li>
    <li>Extended Care nurses</li>
</ul>
    I developed a participant recruitment screener for our 3rd party recruiting partner to find 12 nurses who:
<ul>
    <li>Ranged in nursing experience</li>
    <li>Worked in either Acute Care (e.g. ICU) or Extended Care (e.g. Care Home)</li>
    <li>Ranged in experience using an enteral feeding pump</li>
    <li>Ranged in frequency using the feeding pump during the week</li>
</ul>    
    Interviews<br />
    Interview Structure:<br />
    Interviews were conducted as 1-on-1 sessions at a research facility and lasted 60 minutes.
<ol>
    <li>Intro: welcomed participant, provided session overview</li>
    <li>Background: asked questions regarding feeding pump experience</li>
    <li>Device Introduction: introduced feeding pump whose UI was being updated</li>
    <li>Concept Evaluation: presented different concepts for each feature, observed usability, ease of use, and preferences</li>
    <li>Wrap-Up: thanked and compensated participant</li>
</ol>
    Stimuli<br />
    Feature 1 UI Concepts: Programming different feeding settings<br />
    <!-- D1-A image -->
    <img src="images/feeding_pump_img3.png" alt="Concept D1-A screenshot"><br />
    D1-A: adjust each digit by moving underline (1 zero shown)<br />

    <img src="images/feeding_pump_img4.png" alt="Concept D1-B screenshot"><br />
    D1-B: adjust each digit with moving underline (3 zeroes shown)<br />

    <img src="images/feeding_pump_img5.png" alt="Concept D2 screenshot"><br />
    D2-A: press and hold to increment by 1, then by 5, then by 10<br />
    D2-B: press and hold to increment by 1 (constant speed)<br />
    D2-C: press and hold to increment by 1 (faster speed)<br />
    D2-D: press and hold to increment by 10, tap to increment by 1<br />

    Questions:
<ol>
    <li>How many zeroes do users want to see when starting to program?</li>
    <li>Do users want to move between digit spots to adjust specific digits (D1) or adjust the entire number (D2)?</li>
    <li>When pressing and holding (D2) the + or - buttons, how fast should the number increment?</li>
</ol>
    Feature 2 UI Concepts: Navigating to and viewing flush (water) settings<br />
    
    <img src="images/feeding_pump_img6.png" alt="Concept F1 screenshot"><br />
    F1: Show Flush button on Feeding screen<br />

    <img src="images/feeding_pump_img7.png" alt="Concept F1 (cont.) screenshot"><br />
    F1 (cont.): flush button and 5 sec flush information pop-up<br />

    Questions:
<ol>
    <li>Do users notice the difference between the Feeding screen and the Flush pop-up?</li>
    <li>How long should the pop-up persist on the screen?</li>
</ol>
    Feature 3 UI Concepts: Switching display into Night Display<br />

    <img src="images/feeding_pump_img8.png" alt="Concept N1 screenshot"><br />
    N1: Night Display button on Pause screen, reduced menu on Feeding screen<br />

    <img src="images/feeding_pump_img9.png" alt="Concept N1 (cont.) screenshot"><br />
    N1 (cont.): reduced menu on Feeding screen<br />

    <img src="images/feeding_pump_img10.png" alt="Concept N2 screenshot"><br />
    N2: physical Night Display button on pump's frame, full menu on Feeding screen<br />

    Questions:
<ol>
    <li>Do users want to toggle Night Display on the Feeding screen or the Pause screen?</li>
    <li>Do users need to have a full menu on the Feeding screen when in Night Display?</li>
    <li>Do users prefer the Night Display button to be a UI button or a physical button on the pump?</li>
</ol>

<h2>
    Findings
</h2>

<h4>
    Feature 1: Programming different feeding settings<br />
</h4>
    WINNER: D1-A<br />
    
    10/12 participants preferred D1-A (moving underline with 1 zero shown) over the other concepts. They felt D1-A required
    much less time and was easier to enter the desire values with.<br />
    Feature 2: Navigating to and viewing flush (water) settings<br />
    WINNER: F1<br />
    
    Almost all participants liked having the flush info accessible via pop-up. They liked that the pop-up disappeared on
    its own. A few wished the pop-up persisted slightly longer for adequate reading time and a few were unsure what the
    bottom-most volume ("600 mL") represented and requested a clear label.<br />
    Feature 3: Switching display into Night Display<br />
    WINNER: N2<br />
    
    All participants preferred the N2 concept (separate, physical button) and liked having all button labels accessible and
    shown on the Feeding screen.<br />
    Participants felt important info was sufficient and easy to read, even from a distance or when the testing room lights
    were dimmed. Several felt it was not intuitive to find the button in the Pause screen (N1). Participants wished Night
    Display would stay On until they pressed the button to turn it Off.<br />

    RECOMMENDATIONS<br />
    Using the qualitative and performance data from the user study, the following concept recommendations were made for
    each of the 4 tested features:<br />
    
    Feature 1: Programming different feeding settings<br />
    Recommendation: Implement D1-A with elements of D1-B
<ul>
    <li>ensure underline is easy to see (e.g. improve contrast)</li>
    <li>utilize +/- symbols for incrementation (not up/down arrows)</li>
    <li>improve Next Digit button location so button is readily apparent</li>
</ul><br />

Feature 2: Navigating to flush settings<br />
    Recommendation: Implement F1<br />
<ul>
    <li>ensure bottom-most value clearly refers to volume delivered (e.g. "Total Flushed")</li>
    <li>consider increasing pop-up persistence time</li>
    <li>consider adding Show Flush button on Pause screen</li>
</ul><br />

Feature 3: Switching display into Night Display<br />
    Recommendation: Implement a solution that captures convenience of N2 (turning on with single button press) without
    requiring a physical button. The physical button would derogate the visual aesthetic of the device and may increase
    confusion with other physical buttons.<br />
<ul>
    <li>explore ways to incorporate Night Display button on Feeding screen</li>
    <li>consider having Night Display stay On until user presses button to turn Off</li>
    <li>if physical button: ensure there is no confusion with the Power button</li>
</ul>

<h2>    
    Redo<br />
</h2>    
<h4> 
    If I could redo the project:
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Conduct a Heuristic Evaluation first: down-select from 5 Programming concepts</li>
    <li>Consider remote sessions for Usability (cheaper, wider geographic reach for international goals)</li>
    <li>Utilize more realistic pump screen proxy</li>
    <li>Conduct 2nd round of Usability for statistical power: 15+/user group</li>
    <li>5-sec Usability test</li>
</ul>
