<h3>
    About
</h3>

<h4>
    As part of the SI 501: Contextual Inquiry & Consulting course, our graduate student team conducted a contextual inquiry
    for Menlo Innovations, a software and management consultancy. We completed 1:1 interviews, affinity walls, and data
    analysis to meet the following objectives:
</h4>
<ol>
    <li>understand how employees used a physical financial metrics board</li>
    <li>inform recommendations for an optimized financial metrics board</li>
</ol>

    Menlo Innovations asked us to optimize the way financial metrics are communicated and presented to employees to maximize employee engagement and possibly improve employee productive and work.<br />

    <h4>Background</h4>
    Menlo Innovations utilizes Open Book Management and currently displays financial metrics on a whiteboard (called "Front
    Office Open Book Board" or FOOBB) in an open meeting room. With OBM, management hopes employees will become more
    engaged in their work and adopt efficient, economic-based decisions when completing work. Menlo Innovations held
    weekly, company-wide meetings to discuss the financial metrics together. While employees grasp the definitions of some
    line items on the boards, few are able to connect associated metrics to form a holistic understanding of the company’s
    overall financial health. As a result, employees may not be performing as effectively as they could be.

    <h4>THE CHALLENGE</h4>
    Select one concept for each of the 3 tested features to move forward with.

    <img src="images/menlo_img3.png" alt="FOOBB">

<h3>
    The Problem
</h3>
Upper management felt that the FOOBB (financial metrics) board could be improved and optimized for employees. Employees
may have been having difficulty interpreting financials on the board due to the way it presents information or more
personal challenges specific to the employees. <br />

Our goal was to understand the context of the board's use, uncover any difficulties employees were having in their
interactions with the board, and highlight areas for improving the way Open Book Management is implemented at Menlo.

<h3>
    Methodology
</h3>
1. Immersion | 2. Participants | 3. Interviews | 4. Analysis | 5. Findings | 6. Recommendations
<h4>1. Immersion</h4>
We sat down with Menlo Innovations for a deep dive into its organization structure and its application of Open Book
Management. We clearly defined the project’s scope and identified responsibilities for both the research and client
teams. After our initial client meeting, we sat in on a weekly financial metrics meeting to gauge the general dynamic
as well as employee understanding, morale, and engagement

<h4>2. Participants</h4>
As outlined by the client, the intended users of the financial metrics board were upper management and the following
roles:
<ul>
    <li>Project Managers</li>
    <li>Software Developers</li>
    <li>Quality Advocates</li>
    <li>High-Tech Anthropologist</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Interviews</h4>
Interviews were conducted with end users (employees) in a meeting space at Menlo Innovations. Interviews were conducted
as one-on-one, 60- to 90-minute in-depth discussions.<br />

Our goal for conducting the interviews was to answer these overarching questions:
<ul>
    <li>How do employees understand the financial metrics board and Menlo’s overall financial status?</li>
    <li>How can the weekly financial meetings be optimized?</li>
    <li>How does their understanding of the financial metrics impact their work?</li>
    <li>Are there gaps between management's expectations and how employees behave?</li>
    <li>What metrics do they find valuable that should be better understood by other employees?</li>
</ul>

Interview Structure<br />
(a) Intro & Background
<ul>
    <li>welcomed participant</li>
    <li>provided session overview</li>
    <li>discussed financial understanding</li>
    <li>discussed initial impressions of the metrics board</li>
</ul>

(b) Weekly Meetings
<ul>
    <li>participant gave detailed account of the last meeting</li>
</ul>

(c) Financial Understanding
<ul>    
    <li>participant discussed understanding of the financial big picture</li>
    <li>participant asked to explain associations between different metrics</li>
</ul>
 
(d) Wrap-up
<ul>
    <li> asked follow-up questions   </li>
    <li> thanked the participant  </li>
</ul>

<h4> 4. Analysis </h4>
INTERPRETATION SESSIONS<br />
After each interview, the team sat down and listened to the interview recording, highlighting notable comments and findings.<br />
AFFINITY DIAGRAMMING<br />
400+ key comments and quotes from interviews were attached to sticky notes:<br />
Notes were clustered with 5-6 other relevant comments/quotes. Clusters were then grouped (and so on) to form a hierarchy of granular patterns moving upwards to high-level themes.<br />

<img src="images/menlo_img4.jpeg" alt="Sticky Notes">
<img src="images/menlo_img5.png" alt="Affinity Hierarchy">
<img src="images/menlo_img6.jpeg" alt="Completed Affinity Diagram">
<br />
We constructed the following themes:
<ul>
    <li>Presentation of Data </li>
    <li>Employee's Individual Differences</li>
    <li>Lack of Understanding & Direction</li>
    <li>Constraints</li>
    <li>FOOBB Methods</li>
    <li>Business Methods</li>
</ul>

<h4> 5. Findings </h4>
Analysis gave way to the following findings:<br />
Positives
<ul>
    <li>employees understand FOOBB much better when coworkers share the "why" behind the metrics </li>
    <li> employees use certain metrics like Billable Hours as markers for Menlo's financial health</li>
    <li> Project Managers often have an easier time understanding metrics and the bigger picture than other employees</li>
    <li> a majority want to understand FOOBB better</li>
    <li> some employees use FOOBB to inform their personal finances</li>
    <li> employees find pairing with a coworker to be valuable</li>
</ul>

Issues<br />
We uncovered high-level issues with FOOBB and Menlo's implementation of Open Book Management:
<ul>
    <li> connections are hard to make on the board</li>
    <li> info on the board is not easily digestible</li>
    <li> the board is not conducive to visual learning</li>
</ul>

a) PRESENTATION OF DATA

b) ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE DIVERSITY
<ul>
    <li> the board does not account for individual preferences</li>
    <li> employees without management experience struggle</li>
    <li> those less familiar with the flow of business were more pessimistic about Menlo's financial health</li>
</ul>

c) UNCLEAR EXPECTATIONS
<ul>
    <li> employees are expected to invest emotionally</li>
    <li> management expects employees to spend extra time using metrics to improve the business</li>
    <li> employees are busy with client work</li>
</ul>

d) VALUE OF WEEKLY MEETINGS
<ul>
    <li> employees wished less time was spent calculating</li>
    <li> employees want to make proactive decisions</li>
    <li> the story behind the metric is imperative to teaching</li>
</ul>

e) INEFFICIENT QUARTER TRANSITIONS
<ul>
    <li> new quarters = new metrics to learn, wastes time</li>
    <li> researching new metrics does not follow a process</li>
</ul>

<h4> 6. Recommendations </h4>
We brainstormed and potential solutions that Menlo could use to improve the way employees interact with Open Book Management and the giant whiteboard.<br />

To narrow our solutions, we evaluated them against the following qualities:
<ul>
    <li> political support among upper management</li>
    <li> political support among employees</li>
    <li> simplicity</li>
    <li> degree to which the problem is solved</li>
    <li> financial cost</li>
    <li> required effort</li>
    <li> technical feasibility</li>
</ul>

Prioritizing and down-selecting the solutions left the following as our top recommendations for the client:<br />

Train employees on Open Book Management
<img src="images/menlo_img7.png" alt="">
<ul>
    <li> align the team on the value of OBM</li>
    <li> onboard newer employees and those who struggle with FOOBB </li>
    <li> pair a learner with a mentor to ensure constant learning and efficiency</li>
    <li>educate employees on the nature of business and consulting </li>
</ul>

Make creating the "story" easy
<img src="images/menlo_img8.png" alt="">
<ul>
    <li> consider creating 'mad-libs' to allow employees to plug-n-present the story</li>
    <li> devise tips for researching, analyzing, and presenting different metrics</li>
</ul>

Clearly communicate expectations
<img src="images/menlo_img9.png" alt="">
<ul>
    <li> spend time in the weekly meeting reinforcing employee expectations</li>
    <li> bridge the gap between expectations and reality</li>
    <li> discuss ways to work around the time required for billable work</li>
    <li> ensure employees do not feel guilty when spending time on FOOBB</li>
</ul>

Visualize data to show connections
<img src="images/menlo_img10.png" alt="">
<ul>
    <li> consider creating graphs connecting metrics to be updated weekly</li>
    <li> group related metrics adjacent or near each other to promote connections</li>
</ul>

Implement a feedback system
<img src="images/menlo_img11.png" alt="">
<ul>
    <li> encourage employees to provide feedback for a given financial decision</li>
    <li> ensure employees feel heard and prioritized within the business model</li>
</ul>

Optimize meeting quality
<img src="images/menlo_img12.png" alt="">
<ul>
    <li> use weekly meetings to analyze metrics and discuss proactive solutions</li>
    <li> spend less time number-crunching and more time thinking analytically</li>
    <li> consider deciding next week's meeting topic in this week's meeting</li>
    <li> use the end of quarters to devise research approaches for new metrics</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reflection</h3>
What did I learn?
<ul>
    <li>Ethnography is not Usability:
    contextual inquiry should be much less directed than a typical usability session with a very flexible interview protocol</li>
    <li>Interviews with stakeholders can be just as valuable:
    interviewing the CEO highlighted unmet expectations that had not been communicated to the team </li>
</ul>
What would I do differently?
<ul>
    <li>Conduct interviews in the same environment as observation:
    keep participants thinking in-context so they provide relevant answers and recollect nuances they might otherwise forget</li>
    <li>Brainstorm ways to increase employee buy-in:
    regardless of how great a product is, users must want to use it, so increasing buy-in and retention could have helped this system </li>
</ul>
