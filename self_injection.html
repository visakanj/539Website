        About
    </h2>

    <h4>
        The client, Pharma-C, had already released its drug to the market but it was only available for use with a syringe and
        vial. The client wanted to select the ideal self-injection device to make treatment easier for the target patients. To
        do so, the client needed to understand how patients were currently using their syringes and investigate how potential
        users might feel about the 3 off-the-shelf devices being considered.

    </h4>
    Research Goals
    <ol>
        <li>Understand the self-administration landscape</li>
        <li>Explore the benefits and drawbacks of the 3 self-injection devices through metrics and qualitative data</li>
    </ol>

    The Challenge<br />
    Select a single device that best suits the needs of potential users, is easy to use, and improves the self-administration experience.

    <h2>
        Methodology
    </h2>
    <h4>Participants</h4>
    The target users were identified to be:
    <ul>
        <li>patients with autoimmune diseases</li>
        <li>healthcare professionals who worked with these patients</li>
    </ul>

    I created a participant recruitment screener (questionnaire) to be used by our 3rd party recruiting firm. We were looking for 25 patients who:
    <ul>
        <li>ranged in age and gender</li>
        <li>experienced an autoimmune disease</li>
        <li>ranged in dexterity limitation (a side effect of the disease)</li>
        <li>ranged in experience level with self-administration (naïve, syringe/vial, pre-filled syringe, injector).</li>
    </ul>

    We scheduled 15 healthcare professionals, nurses and caregivers, who ranged in treatment experience and had varying experience levels with different self-administration methods.
    The types of participants we recruited would be integral to answering these questions:<br />
    How would the disease’s impact on lifestyle influence someone’s preferred method of administration?<br />
    e.g. "How would a rheumatoid arthritis patient’s dexterity limitations influence her administration method preference?"<br />
    How would disease symptoms affect device preference and use?<br />
    e.g. "How would a lupus patient’s feeling of lack of control impact his device preference for self-injecting?"<br />
    To answer these questions later, the team would need to cross-reference research data and participant feedback with the participant’s device experience and dexterity limitation. To prepare, we mapped patient participants by these factors:

    <h4>Interviews</h4>
    Interview structure:<br />
    Interviews were conducted as 1-on-1 sessions at a research facility and lasted 60-75 minutes. <br />
    <ol>
        <li>Intro: welcomed participant, provided session overview</li>
        <li>Background: asked questions regarding medical conditions, self-administration experience, experience working with patients</li>
        <li>Current Context: discussed impact of disease on life, current treatment methods</li>
        <li>Device Assessment: participant received training and performed 2 injections with each device on a foam pad, looked for impressions, difficulties, and use errors</li>
        <li>Device Comparison: asked participant to compare 3 devices and rank by preference</li>
        <li>Wrap-up: thanked and compensated participant</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Stimuli</h4>
    During the usability portion of the interview, participants were shown 3 devices: (these were not the actual devices used) <br />
    <ul>
        <li>Device #1: push down on the top</li>
        

        <li>Device #2: press the end button</li>

        <li>push against the skin</li>
    </ul>
        
    <img src="images/selfinjection_img3.png" alt="Device 1">
    <img src="images/selfinjection_img4.jpg" alt="Device 2">
    <img src="images/selfinjection_img5.png" alt="Device 3"><br />


    Aside from appearance, the devices differed in their methods of activation.

    <h4>Findings</h4>
    Disease Landscape<br />
    We asked participants to describe their experiences with their medical conditions. We explored each of the disease landscapes to understand how the conditions affected the participants’ everyday lives. (Diseases anonymized due to
    confidentiality).<br />
    
    AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE #1 & #2
    <ul>
        <li>Pushes someone into early retirement</li>
        <li>Makes daily tasks like showering, cooking, and driving difficult</li>
        <li> that involve dexterity like playing piano can be impossible</li>
    </ul>
    
    AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE #3
    <ul>
        <li>Fatigue and ‘brain fog’ make it difficult to function in the morning</li>
        <li>Body stiffness make it painful to walk</li>
        <li>Finger locking can affect everyday tasks like cooking and dressing</li>
    </ul>
    
    AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE #4
    <ul>
        <li>Person becomes lost mid-conversation</li>
        <li>Hands lock up and experience tremors</li>
    </ul>

Treatment Needs & Goals<br />
We used participant experiences to write a visual story about the self-administration process.<br /><br />
    <img src="images/selfinjection_img6.png" alt="Customer Journey">

Participants discussed their motivations and goals when self-administering the treatments for their conditions.<br />
They want to:
<ul>
    <li>Reduce injection time and steps</li>
    <li>Experience less pain when injecting</li>
    <li>Receive the complete dose</li>
    <li>Minimize disruption to their day</li>
    <li>Maintain a regimented treatment routine</li>
    <li>Feel confident and in control of the treatment</li>
</ul>

Device Usability Assessment<br />
An understanding of the current context would not be enough to choose 1 of the 3 devices to move forward with.<br />
Therefore, we had participants perform injections on a foam pad with each of the devices and discussed the following 4 factors:
<ol>
    <li> APPEARANCE & SIZE: shape, color, style visual treatment  </li>
    <li> ERGONOMICS & EASE OF USE: grip, comfort, handling</li>
    <li> MODE OF ACTUATION: thoughts on activation, feeling of control</li>
    <li> FEEDBACK: knowing the injection began and completed</li>
</ol>

We analyzed the findings and compared the 3 devices using visual frequencies:
    <img src="images/selfinjection_img7.jpg" alt="Visual Frequencies">
Size of the circles corresponds to the number of participants who mentioned characteristics related to these attributes.<br /><br />

We had participants rank the 3 devices:
    <img src="images/selfinjection_img8.jpg" alt="Device Rankings">
We found that participants with moderate to severe dexterity limitations were more likely to prefer Device #1 due to its easier activation:
    <img src="images/selfinjection_img9.jpg" alt="Activation">

Injection-naïve (those without injection experience) were more likely to prefer Device #1, mainly because it was easier to learn to use, appeared less intimidating, and was easier to activate:
    <img src="images/selfinjection_img10.jpg" alt="Injection-naive">

<h4>RECOMMENDATION</h4>
We found that Device #1 was the ideal choice to move forward with.
<ul>
    <li> Healthcare professionals strongly preferred to train patients on it</li>
    <li>Patients with moderate-severe dexterity limitations strongly preferred it (and these represented the likely users)</li>
    <li> 100% of injections were successful with Device #1</li>
    <li>Participants felt more comfortable and in control when injecting with Device #1</li>
</ul>

<h4>IMPACT</h4>
AUTOIMMUNE PATIENTS...
<ul>
    <li>interact with an approachable, less intimidating injection device</li>
    <li>give the injection with less difficulty due to ergonomic shape</li>
    <li>feel more in control when giving themselves medication</li>
    <li>be confident they are receiving all the medication</li>
</ul>

NURSES AND CAREGIVERS...
<ul>
    <li>can help patients reach higher levels of autonomy</li>
    <li>train patients to give themselves injections with less confusion</li>
    <li>have higher patient adherence to the medication</li>
</ul>

THE CLIENT...
<ul>
    <li>has fewer patient complications with the syringe/vial system</li>
    <li>has higher patient adherence to the medication</li>
    <li>has medication more likely to be prescribed by practitioners</li>
</ul>
